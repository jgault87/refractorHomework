# refractorHomework
Author: JJ Gault contact: john.gault@du.edu

This project is my first homework assignment for Fullstack Flex coding bootcamp.
The goal of the project is to make accessibility changes to the code so that is would be concise and search engine ready as well as having CSS styling that is more easily accessible/editable. Code refactoring is a necessary building block to understanding code structure as a whole.

Please note to the homework reviewer - I commented out the duplicate code for this project as to show what was written in excess for the page functionality but I did not take it out completely as to leave a trace on what exactly I identified as excess.

Thank you!
